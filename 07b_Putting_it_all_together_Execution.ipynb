    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to bring our **ReAct agent** to life and see it in action! In this section, we'll instantiate the `ReActAgent` class with our configurations and run a few example queries. Pay close attention to the output – you'll be able to follow the agent's reasoning process and how it decides to use the tools we provided.\n",

    "> **Important Considerations:**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Keep in mind that the agent's responses can vary based on the specific question, the underlying language model, the prompt design, and even settings like temperature. This exercise is designed to illustrate the *potential* of building intelligent agents with Llama Stack. Creating a production-ready, perfectly conversational agent often involves further iteration and fine-tuning of these components. Embrace the journey and observe the process!\n"

    "\n",
    "With our environment successfully prepared in the previous section, it's time for the main event! In this part of the lab, we will take all the pieces we've assembled – our Llama Stack server, the registered MCP tools providing external capabilities, our populated Vector Database for RAG, and our understanding of ReAct agents – and put them into action.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is where you'll see the true power of Llama Stack agents come to life as we build and execute a sophisticated agent capable of reasoning, interacting with multiple external services, and accessing domain-specific knowledge to answer complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "By working through this section, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* See how to configure a ReAct agent with multiple toolgroups and a custom prompt.\n",
    "* Understand how an agent selects and utilizes different tools based on the user's request.\n",
    "* Observe the agent's \"Chain of Thought\" as it breaks down a complex problem.\n",
    "* Experience how RAG is integrated into the agent's workflow to provide informed responses.\n",
    "* Appreciate the flexibility and power of combining various Llama Stack components to build intelligent applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's connect everything and unleash the potential of our multi-talented Llama Stack agent!\n",
