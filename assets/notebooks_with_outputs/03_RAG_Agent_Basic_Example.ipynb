    "# Getting Familiar with RAG Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the lab, we will review some basic capabilities of RAG, by the end of this section, you will be able to: \n",
    "- Initialize the RAG *agent* to use the LlamaStack server we created in previous sections\n",
    "- Create a simple VectorDB to contain our documents \n",
    "- Embed (insert) our documents into the VectorDB\n",
    "- Retrieve answers based on our documents using the RAG agent and LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It's a novel approach that combines information retrieval and natural language generation techniques to improve the efficiency of knowledge graph-based systems, such as question-answering models and text summarization. The core idea is to leverage pre-trained language models to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base or database, and then use this retrieved information to generate high-quality responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, RAG allows us to take documents (PDF, Markdown, Websites or other) that are not availble within our model and allow our agent to provide answers based on the content of those documents. Here are a few examples of what enterprise companies might use RAG: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Customer Service Chatbots with RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "A large retail company could use RAG to power their customer service chatbots. When a customer asks a question about a product, the chatbot uses RAG to retrieve relevant information from its knowledge base and generate a response that is both accurate and helpful. For example, if a customer asks \"What are the features of the new Somephone 13\", the chatbot can use RAG to retrieve information from its database and respond with a detailed list of features, including specifications, pricing, and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Personalized Product Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "An e-commerce company like could use RAG to generate personalized product recommendations for customers based on their browsing history and purchase behavior. When a customer visits the website, RAG is used to retrieve information about products that are similar to what they've previously purchased or browsed. The system then generates a list of recommended products, along with detailed descriptions and prices, to help the customer make an informed purchasing decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Automated Content Generation for Marketing Campaigns**\n",
    "\n",
    "A marketing agency could use RAG to generate high-quality content for their clients' marketing campaigns. For example, if a client wants to create a blog post about the benefits of using artificial intelligence in marketing, RAG can be used to retrieve relevant information from its database and generate a draft of the article. The system can then refine the content based on the client's brand voice and style, ensuring that the final product meets their expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Technical Writing Assistance**\n",
    "\n",
    "A software development company could use RAG to assist with technical writing tasks such as generating user manuals, API documentation, and technical guides. When a developer needs to write code comments or documentation for a new feature, RAG can be used to retrieve relevant information from its database and generate high-quality text that is both accurate and concise."

    "## Lab Summary: Getting Familiar with RAG Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you were introduced to the fundamental concepts and basic capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Llama Stack framework. You learned how RAG combines information retrieval and natural language generation to enhance knowledge graph-based systems. This allows an agent to provide answers based on documents not originally available to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the exercises, you learned to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initialize a RAG agent:** You set up the RAG agent to work with the LlamaStack server.\n",
    "* **Create and manage a VectorDB:** You created a simple VectorDB to store documents and learned how to embed (insert) documents into it.\n",
    "* **Process and embed documents:** You saw how documents are processed and chunked before being embedded into the VectorDB.\n",
    "* **Retrieve answers using the RAG agent:** You practiced retrieving answers to questions based on the content of the documents stored in the VectorDB, utilizing the RAG agent and an LLM.\n",
    "* **Inspect the agent's process:** You explored how to review the steps the agent takes during retrieval, which is helpful for debugging and understanding the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you gained a foundational understanding of the RAG process, including setting up the necessary components, preparing data, and using a RAG agent to query custom documents. This experience highlights how Llama Stack provides a structured way to implement RAG and manage the lifecycle of vector databases."
