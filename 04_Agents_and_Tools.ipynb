    "You learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Define a basic AI agent:** You created an agent and provided it with instructions on how to behave.\n",
    "* **Utilize built-in tools:** You explored how agents can leverage pre-existing tools within Llama Stack, specifically the `websearch` tool, to gather information from the web.\n",
    "* **Observe agent behavior:** You became familiar with the concepts of \"Turns\" and \"Steps\" that an agent goes through when processing a query, including the crucial \"Tool Call\" step where the agent decides to use a tool.\n",
    "* **Create custom tools:** You experienced how to extend an agent's capabilities by defining your own specialized tool (`get_location`) using Python and decorators.\n",
    "* **Implement prompt chaining:** You explored how to maintain context across multiple user interactions within the same session, allowing the agent to remember previous information and use it to answer subsequent questions more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these exercises, you gained a foundational understanding of how agents operate within the Llama Stack ecosystem and how they can be equipped with tools to perform specific tasks. "
