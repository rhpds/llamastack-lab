    "* **Define a basic AI agent:** You created an agent and provided it with instructions on how to behave.\n",
    "* **Utilize built-in tools:** You explored how agents can leverage pre-existing tools within Llama Stack, specifically the `websearch` tool, to gather information from the web.\n",
    "* **Observe agent behavior:** You became familiar with the concepts of \"Turns\" and \"Steps\" that an agent goes through when processing a query, including the crucial \"Tool Call\" step where the agent decides to use a tool.\n",
    "* **Create custom tools:** You experienced how to extend an agent's capabilities by defining your own specialized tool (`get_location`) using Python and decorators.\n",
    "* **Implement prompt chaining:** You explored how to maintain context across multiple user interactions within the same session, allowing the agent to remember previous information and use it to answer subsequent questions more effectively.\n",
